Chat Q&A sample application is a foundational Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
that allows users to ask questions and receive answers, including those based on their own
private data corpus. The sample application demonstrates how to build a RAG pipeline using
Intel's Edge AI microservices catalog and deploy it optimally on Intel's Edge AI systems.
This sample application simplifies the development, customization, and deployment of chat
applications in diverse deployment scenarios with out-of-the-box support for on-prem and edge
environments.

## Overview and Architecture

### Key Features

Key features include:

- **Optimized RAG pipeline on Intel Edge AI Systems hardware**: The application is
[optimized](./benchmarks.md) to run efficiently on Intel® Edge AI systems hardware, ensuring
high performance and reliability.
- **Customizable RAG pipeline with optimized microservices**: Intel's Edge AI
[inference microservices](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/microservices)
allow developers to customize and adapt specific parts of the application to suit their
deployment and usage needs. For example, developers can customize the data ingestion process
for specific document types without altering the rest of the RAG pipeline. Intel's inference
microservices provide the flexibility to tailor the application for specific deployment scenarios
and usage requirements without compromising performance on the given deployment hardware.
- **Flexible deployment options**: The application provides options for deployment using Docker
Compose and Helm charts, enabling developers to choose the best deployment environment for
their needs.
- **Support for a wide range of open-source models**: Intel's inference microservices provide
flexibility to use the right GenAI models (LLM, for example) as required for target usage.
The application supports various [open-source models](https://huggingface.co/OpenVINO),
allowing developers to select the best models for their use cases.
- **Self-hosting inference**: Perform inference locally or on-premises, ensuring data privacy
and reducing latency.
- **Observability and monitoring**: The application provides observability and monitoring
capabilities using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) & [OpenLIT](https://github.com/openlit/openlit),
enabling developers to monitor the application's performance and health in real-time.

### Technical Architecture

The Chat Q&A sample application includes the following components:

- **LLM inference microservice**: Intel's optimized [OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server)
is used to efficiently run large language models on Intel hardware. Developers also have other
model serving options if required; vLLM with OpenVINO backend and TGI are the options provided.
(*Note: vLLM and TGI are deprecated effective 2025.2.0 release.*)
- **Embedding inference microservice**: Intel's optimized [OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS)](https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/model_server)
and Huggingface [Text Embeddings Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference)
microservice are the options provided to run embedding models efficiently on target Intel
hardware. OVMS is the default option due to performance benefits on Intel hardware.
- **Reranking inference microservice**: Huggingface [Text Embeddings Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-embeddings-inference)
microservice is the model serving choice available.
- **Document ingestion microservice**: The sample [document ingestion](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/microservices/document-ingestion/pgvector)
microservice allows ingestion of common document formats like PDF and DOC, and contents from
web links. It supports a REST endpoint to ingest the documents. The ingestion process creates
embeddings of the documents and stores them in the preferred vector database. The modular
architecture allows users to customize the vector database. The sample application uses the
[PGvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) database. The raw documents are stored in the
[MinIO](https://github.com/minio/minio) datastore, which is also customizable.
- **Chat Q&A backend microservice**: The Chat Q&A backend microservice is responsible for
responding to the user queries. LangChain framework is used to create the RAG chain and provide
the necessary integrations with VectorDB. The backend microservice provides a REST API to
accept user queries.
- **Chat Q&A UI**: A reference UI is provided to enable users quickly try the sample-application.
The  UI is not designed to be a comprehensive guide on the design of UI but is more a functional
implementation to enable quick demo interaction. It allows users to create the context by
uploading the documents and provide weblinks. Users can then interact with the RAG pipeline.
It uses the REST API provided by the document ingestion and Chat Q&A backend for its operations.

All the 3rd party components are not built from source but instead the respective pre-built
images are pulled from their artefactory (Docker hub for example) and used. The model serving
is also reused from their prebuilt versions and used for LLM, Embedding, and Reranker. The
Intel microservices can be built from source. Documentation is provided to help users build
these microservices from source.

Further details on the system architecture and customizable options are available [here](./how-it-works.md).

## How to Use the Application

Refer to the [Get Started](./get-started.md) page to get started with the sample-application.
The UI is the recommended mode of interaction with the sample-application though users can
also use the CLI approach using the REST endpoints. The Chat Q&A sample application consists
of two main parts:

1. **Data Ingestion [Knowledge Building]**: This part is responsible for adding documents to
the Chat Q&A instance. The document ingestion microservice allows creation of this knowledge base.

2. **Generation [Q&A]**: This part allows the user to query the document database and generate
responses. The LLM inference microservice, embedding inference microservice, and reranking
microservice work together to provide accurate and efficient answers to user queries. When a
user submits a question, the embedding model hosted by the chosen model serving (default is
OVMS) transforms it into an embedding, enabling semantic comparison with stored document
embeddings. The vector database searches for relevant embeddings, returning a ranked list of
documents based on semantic similarity. The LLM Inference Microservice generates a context-aware
response from the final set of documents. It is possible to use any supported models to run with
the applications. Detailed documentation provides full information on validated models and
models supported overall.

Refer to the [detailed hardware and software requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md).

This sample application is ready for deployment with Edge Orchestrator. Download the
[deployment package](./get-started/deploy-with-edge-orchestrator.md) and follow the instructions.
