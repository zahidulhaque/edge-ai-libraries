# Release Notes

## Current Release

**Version**: 1.3.3-rc1 \
**Release Date**: 23 April 2026  

**Features**:

- **OVMS-first architecture**: Replaced the standalone `vlm-openvino-serving` microservice with OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS) as the unified inference backend for both VLM captioning and LLM summarization. This is a **breaking change**; the `vlm-inference` subchart and container have been removed.

**HW used for validation**:

- Intel® Xeon® 5 + Intel® Arc&trade; B580 GPU
- Vanilla Kubernetes Cluster

**Known Issues/Limitations**:

- This release includes only limited testing on EMT‑S and EMT‑D, some behaviors may not yet be fully validated across all scenarios.
- HW sizing of the Video Search or Video Summarization pipeline is in progress. Optimization of the pipelines will follow HW sizing.
- Known issues are internally tracked. Reference not provided here.
- `how-to-performance` document is not updated yet. HW sizing details will be added to this section shortly.
- NPU support with OVMS is added as experimental feature and may not work for all models or configurations.
