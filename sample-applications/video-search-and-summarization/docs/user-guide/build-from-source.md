# How to Build from Source

This section shows how to build the Video Search and Summary sample application from source.

> **Note:**
>
> - The dependent microservices can be built separately from their respective microservice folders which is recommended. There is an option provided to build dependencies along with sample application if required.
> - The build instruction is applicable only on an Ubuntu system. Build from source is not supported either for the sample application or the dependent microservices on [Edge Microvisor Toolkit](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-microvisor-toolkit). It is recommended to use prebuilt images on Edge Microvisor Toolkit.

## Prerequisites

1. Follow the instructions given in the [Get Started](./get-started.md) section.
2. Address all [prerequisites](./get-started.md#prerequisites).
3. Configure the required [environment variables](./get-started.md#set-required-environment-variables).
4. If the setup is behind a proxy, ensure `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` are properly set on the shell.

## Steps to Build from Source

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   Clone the Video Summary Sample Application repository:

   ```bash
   # Clone the latest on mainline
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries
   # Alternatively, Clone a specific release branch
   git clone https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries.git edge-ai-libraries -b <release-tag>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

   Go to the directory where the Dockerfile is located:

   ```bash
   cd edge-ai-libraries/sample-applications/video-search-and-summarization
   ```

3. **Build the Docker Image**:

   If you need to customize the application or build your own images, you can use the `build.sh` script included in the repository.

   **3.1 Customizing Build Configuration**

   The application uses registry URL, project name, and tag to build the images.

     ```bash
     export REGISTRY_URL=<your-container-registry-url>    # e.g. "docker.io/username/"
     export PROJECT_NAME=<your-project-name>              # e.g. "video-search-and-summarization"
     export TAG=<your-tag>                                # e.g. "rc4" or "latest"
     ```

   > **_IMPORTANT:_** These variables control how image names are constructed. If `REGISTRY_URL` is **docker.io/username/** and `PROJECT_NAME` is **video-search-and-summarization**, an image would be pulled or built as **docker.io/username/video-search-and-summarization/\<application-name>:tag**. The `<application-name>` is hardcoded in _image_ field of each service in all docker compose files. If `REGISTRY_URL` or `PROJECT_NAME` are not set, blank string will be used to construct the image name. If `TAG` is not set, **latest** will be used by default.

   **3.2 Building Images**

   The build script provides options to build and push the images. Build script provides option to build only the application microservices or build together with all the dependent microservices. The following microservices are dependent: [Multimodal Embedding Serving](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/multimodal-embedding-serving/index.html), [Audio Analyzer](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/audio-analyzer/index.html), [VDMS based data preparation](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/microservices/visual-data-preparation-for-retrieval/vdms), and [VLM microservice](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/microservices/vlm-openvino-serving).

   ```bash

   # Build the sample applications services
   ./build.sh

   # Build the sample applications dependencies
   ./build.sh --dependencies

   # Push all built images to the configured registry
   ./build.sh --push
   ```

   After building, you can verify the created images with:

   ```bash
   docker images | grep <your-project-name>
   ```

4. **Run the Docker Container**:

    The Video Search and Summary application offers multiple stacks and deployment options, to verify the newly created images run the below command to run the application:

    ```bash
    source setup.sh --summary
    ```

5. Accessing the Application

    After successfully starting the application, open a browser and go to `http://<host-ip>:12345` to access the application dashboard.

## Verification

- Ensure that the application is running by checking the Docker container status:

  ```bash
  docker ps
  ```

- Access the application dashboard and verify that it is functioning as expected.

## Building with Copyleft Sources

If you need to include copyleft sources in your build, you can set the following environment variable:

```bash
export ADD_COPYLEFT_SOURCES=true
```

When this environment variable is set to `true`, it allows the Dockerfiles to conditionally include copyleft sources when needed.

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during the build or run process, check the Docker logs for errors:

  ```bash
  docker logs <container-id>
  ```
