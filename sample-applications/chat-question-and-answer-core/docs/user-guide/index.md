Chat Question & Answer (Chat Q&A) Sample Application is a foundational Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline,
enabling users to ask questions and receive answers including on their own private data
corpus. The sample application demonstrates how to build RAG pipelines.
Compared to the
[Chat Question-and-Answer](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/sample-applications/chat-question-and-answer)
implementation, this implementation of Chat Question-and-Answer Core is optimized for
memory footprint, as it is built as a single monolithic application with the entire RAG
pipeline bundled in a single microservice. The microservice supports a bare metal
deployment through docker compose installation to emphasize on the monolithic objective.

## Architecture

### Key Features

Key features include:

- **Optimized RAG pipeline on Intel Tiber AI Systems hardware**: The application
  is [optimized](./benchmarks.md) to run efficiently on Intel® hardware, ensuring high
  performance and reliability. Given the memory optimization, this version is also
  able to address the Core portfolio.
- **Comprehensive Framework Options**: The application supports a diverse range
  of open-source models through both the `OpenVINO toolkit` and `Ollama` frameworks.
  This integration empowers developers to select from a wide array of models available on
  [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/OpenVINO) and
  [Ollama](https://ollama.com/library),
  offering flexibility in choosing the most suitable GenAI models (LLM, for
  example) for their use cases.
- **Self-hosting inference**: Perform inference locally or on-premises, ensuring data
  privacy and reducing latency.
- **Observability and monitoring**: The application provides observability and
  monitoring capabilities using [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) &
  [OpenLIT](https://github.com/openlit/openlit), enabling developers to monitor the
  application's performance and health in real-time.

### Technical Architecture

The Chat Question-and-Answer Core sample application is implemented as a LangChain
based RAG pipeline with all the inference models (i.e. LLM, Embedding, and reranker)
executed in the context of a single OpenVINO™ runtime. The approach is documented
in the OpenVINO toolkit
[documentation](https://blog.openvino.ai/blog-posts/accelerate-inference-of-hugging-face-transformer-models-with-optimum-intel-and-openvino).
Readers are requested to refer to this documentation for the technical details.

With the integration of the Ollama framework, the application expands its
capabilities, offering additional flexibility and model options for developers.
Ollama enhances the pipeline by broadening the scope of available models. For
more information on the Ollama framework, visit its
[official GitHub page](https://github.com/ollama/ollama).

## How to Use the Application

The Chat Question-and-Answer Core sample application consists of two main parts:

1. **Data Ingestion [Knowledge Building]**: This part is responsible for adding
   documents to the Chat Q&A instance. The data ingestion step allows ingestion of
   common document formats like pdf and doc. The ingestion process cleans and formats
   the input document, creates embeddings of the documents using embedding microservice,
   and stores them in the preferred vector database. CPU version of
   [FAISS](https://faiss.ai/index.html) is used as VectorDB.

2. **Generation [Q&A]**: This part allows the user to query the document database
   and generate responses. The LLM model, embedding model, and reranking model work
   together to provide accurate and efficient answers to user queries. When a user
   submits a question, the query is converted to an embedding enabling semantic
   comparison with stored document embeddings. The vector database searches for
   relevant embeddings, returning a ranked list of documents based on semantic
   similarity. The LLM generates a context-aware response from the final set of documents.

For more details, refer to the [Hardware and Software requirements](./get-started/system-requirements.md).
