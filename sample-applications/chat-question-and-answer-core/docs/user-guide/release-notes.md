## Known limitations

- The load time for the application is ~10mins during the first run as the models needs to be downloaded and converted to OpenVINO IR format. Subsequent run with the same model configuration will not have this overhead. However, if the model configuration is changed, it will lead to the download and convert requirement resulting in the load time limitation.
