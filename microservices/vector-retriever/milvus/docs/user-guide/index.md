Retrieves embeddings based on vector similarity. Usually it is used along with a
`dataprep` microservice.

## Overview

The Retrieval Microservice is designed to perform efficient, vector-based searches
 using a vector database such as Milvus. It provides a RESTful API for retrieving
 relevant results based on text queries and optional filters. This microservice is
 optimized for handling large-scale datasets and supports flexible query configurations.

Key Features:

- Text-Based Image/Video Retrieval:

  Accepts text queries and retrieves the top-k most relevant results based on vector
  similarity. Supports optional filters to refine search results.

- Integration with Milvus:

  Utilizes the Milvus vector database for efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings.
  Ensures high performance and scalability for large datasets.

**Programming Language:** Python

## How It Works

1. Query Processing:

   The microservice accepts a text query and optional filters via the
   `/v1/retrieval` endpoint. The query is processed with an embedding model to generate
   embeddings and to retrieve embeddings from the Milvus database.

2. Result Generation:

   The retrieved results include metadata, similarity scores, and unique identifiers.
   Results are returned in JSON format for easy integration with downstream applications.

## Workflow

1. The embedding model generates text embeddings for input descriptions
   (e.g., "traffic jam").
2. The search engine searches the vector database for the top-k most similar matches.
3. Generate results with the matched vector ids and metadata.
