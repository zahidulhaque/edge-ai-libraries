# Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server <a name="deep-learning-streamer-pipeline-server"></a>

## Overview

Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server (DL Streamer Pipeline Server) is a Python-based, interoperable containerized microservice for easy development and deployment of video analytics pipelines. It is built on top of [GStreamer](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/) and [Deep Learning Streamer (DL Streamer)](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/dlstreamer/blob/main/docs/user-guide/index.md), providing video ingestion and deep learning inferencing functionalities.

Video analytics involves the conversion of video streams into valuable insights through the application of video processing, inference, and analytics operations. It finds applications in various business sectors including healthcare, retail, entertainment, and industrial domains. The algorithms utilized in video analytics are responsible for performing tasks such as object detection, classification, identification, counting, and tracking on the input video stream.


> **Note:** Detailed documentation for Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server can be found on
[the documentation website](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/index.html).

## Architecture

![Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server Architecture](./docs/user-guide/_assets/dls-pipelineserver-simplified-arch.png)

## Prerequisites For Target System

- [System Requirements](./docs/user-guide/get-started/system-requirements.md)

## Quick try out

Follow the steps in this section to quickly pull the latest pre-built Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server docker image followed by running a sample usecase.

### Pull the image and start container

- Clone the repository and change to the docker directory inside DL Streamer Pipeline Server project.

  ```sh
    git clone <link-to-repository>
    cd <path/to/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker>
  ```

- Pull the image with the latest tag from registry

   ```sh
     # Update DLSTREAMER_PIPELINE_SERVER_IMAGE in <path/to/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/.env> if necessary
     docker pull "$(grep ^DLSTREAMER_PIPELINE_SERVER_IMAGE= .env | cut -d= -f2-)"
   ```

- Run the image with the [compose file](./docker/docker-compose.yml) provided in this repo.

   ```sh
     docker compose up
   ```

### Run default sample

Once the container is up, we will send a pipeline request to Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server to run a detection model on a warehouse video. Both the model and video are provided as default sample in the docker image.

We will send the below curl request to run the inference.
It comprises of a source file path which is `warehouse.avi`, a destination, with metadata directed to a json fine in `/tmp/resuts.jsonl` and frames streamed over RTSP with id `pallet-defect-detection`. Additionally, we will also provide the GETi model path that would be used for detecting defective boxes on the video file.

Open another terminal and send the following curl request
``` sh
    curl http://localhost:8080/pipelines/user_defined_pipelines/pallet_defect_detection -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
    "source": {
        "uri": "file:///home/pipeline-server/resources/videos/warehouse.avi",
        "type": "uri"
    },
    "destination": {
        "metadata": {
            "type": "file",
            "path": "/tmp/results.jsonl",
            "format": "json-lines"
        },
        "frame": {
            "type": "rtsp",
            "path": "pallet-defect-detection"
        }
    },
    "parameters": {
        "detection-properties": {
            "model": "/home/pipeline-server/resources/models/geti/pallet_defect_detection/deployment/Detection/model/model.xml",
            "device": "CPU"
        }
    }
}'
```

> **Note:** When using a custom `gvawatermark` configuration (e.g., `displ-cfg=show-roi=...` or `displ-cfg=hide-roi=...`) in your pipeline, set `"overlay": false` in the frame destination to prevent the RTSP stream from adding a second `gvawatermark` with default settings that overrides your filtering configuration:
> ```json
> "frame": {
>     "type": "rtsp",
>     "path": "pallet-defect-detection",
>     "overlay": false
> }
> ```

The REST request will return a pipeline instance ID, which can be used as an identifier to query later the pipeline status or stop the pipeline instance. For example, a6d67224eacc11ec9f360242c0a86003.

- To view the metadata, open another terminal and run the following command,
  ```sh
    tail -f /tmp/results.jsonl
  ```

- RTSP Stream will be accessible at `rtsp://<SYSTEM_IP_ADDRESS>:8554/pallet-defect-detection`.  Users can view this on any media player e.g. vlc (as a network stream), ffplay etc

  ![sample frame RTSP stream](./docs/user-guide/_assets/sample-pallet-defect-detection.png)

To check the pipeline status and stop the pipeline send the following requests,

 - view the pipeline status that you triggered in the above step.
   ```sh
    curl --location -X GET http://localhost:8080/pipelines/status
   ```

 - stop a running pipeline instance,
   ```sh
    curl --location -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/pipelines/{instance_id}
   ```

Now you have successfully run the Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server container, sent a curl request to start a pipeline within the microservice which runs the Geti based pallet defect detection model on a sample warehouse video. Then, you have also looked into the status of the pipeline to see if everything worked as expected and eventually stopped the pipeline as well.

## Build from source

You can build either an optimized or an extended DL Streamer Pipeline Server image (for both Ubuntu22 and Ubuntu24) based on your use case. The extended image contains the Geti SDK, the OpenVINO Model API and ROS2 on top of the optimized image.

Note: Ensure to set the right values in the [.env file](./docker/.env) for building DL Streamer Pipeline Server optimized image and DL Streamer Pipeline Server extended image when you follow the below steps. The mentioned file has the necessary details written as comments.

### Prerequisites
Add the following lines in [.env file](./docker/.env) if you are behind a proxy.

  ``` sh
  http_proxy= # example: http_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:891
  https_proxy= # example: https_proxy=http://proxy.example.com:891
  no_proxy= # example: no_proxy=localhost,127.0.0.1
  ```

Update the following lines in [.env file](./docker/.env) for choosing the right base and target images and also for naming the image that gets built.

  ``` sh
  # See .env file for example values
  BASE_IMAGE=

  # See .env file for example values
  DLSTREAMER_PIPELINE_SERVER_IMAGE=

  # See .env file for example values
  BUILD_TARGET=
  ```

  Note: If you do not have access to the above mentioned `BASE_IMAGE`, then you can build [DL Streamer docker image from source](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/dlstreamer/blob/main/docs/user-guide/dev_guide/advanced_install/advanced_build_docker_image.md) and use it as `BASE_IMAGE` in the above mentioned `.env` file

### Build Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server image and start container <a name="build-image-and-start-container"></a>

Run the following commands:

To enable GPU/NPU you must first grant the container user access to GPU/NPU device(s).Because Docker Compose does not evaluate shell expressions, you need to determine the `render` group ID on the host system and define/export it as an environment variable **before** running Docker Compose. You can add group ID in `[WORKDIR]/edge-ai-libraries/microservices/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/docker/.env`
To check the render ID group you can use below command:

  ```sh
  stat -c "%g" /dev/dri/render* | head -1
  ```

  ```sh
  cd docker
  source .env # sometimes this is needed as docker compose doesn't always pick up the necessary env variables
  docker compose build
  ```

   The docker image of DL Streamer Pipeline Server is now built (based on the .env changes done above) and available for you to run.

  ```sh
  docker compose up
  ```

### Run default sample
Refer to the relevant [Get Started](https://docs.openedgeplatform.intel.com/dev/edge-ai-libraries/dlstreamer-pipeline-server/get-started.html#run-default-sample) section to run default sample upon bringing up Intel® Deep Learning Streamer Pipeline Server container.
