This microservice delivers a novel approach to video summarization. By employing a configurable,
multi-level architecture and enhanced temporal modeling, it progressively analyzes video content
to generate significantly more accurate and context-aware summaries.

The overall high-level design is shown as below:

Among all the components, `Multi-level Video Understanding` refers to this microservice.
`Video Chunking` is a library implemented in this Open Edge Platform (OEP) suite:
[video-chunking-utils](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/edge-ai-libraries/tree/main/libraries/video-chunking-utils).
`Vision-Language Model Serving` and `Large Language Model Serving` are dependent
services required by this microservice, running on OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## Overview

To handle long video summarization, we design a multi-level framework where each level operates
via a recurrent approach, effectively control the context length to improve computational
efficiency and comply with model constraints or GPU memory constraints.

This framework operates in three stages:

1. Detects scene-switch boundaries to segment the long video into chunks.
2. Uses VLM to generate captions for each of these short video clips.
3. Uses LLM hierarchically and recurrently aggregates the textual captions to a coherent global
summary. A dedicated temporal enhancement component is employed at each level to strengthen
the connections between units.

**Features**

- **Feature 1**: Process video from local files or http(s) links.
- **Feature 2**: Automatic model download and conversion on startup.
- **Feature 3**: Containerization with Docker.
- **Feature 4**: RESTful API with FastAPI with support for concurrent requests.
- **Feature 5**: Support specify video chunking method in user requests.
- **Feature 6**: Support specify multi-level settings in user requests.
- **Feature 7**: Support specify temporal enhancement settings in user requests.
- **Feature 8**: Designed to work effortlessly with GenAI model servings that provide
OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## How It Works

The Multi-level Video Understanding microservice unlocks straightforward video summarization.
Users simply submit a video file. The service then seamlessly analyzes the content through its
intelligent, multi-level framework to generate a summary, which is returned directly to the
client. A comprehensive RESTful API is provided to access and control key features.

## Models supported

The service automatically downloads and manages the required models based on configuration.
Any OpenAI-compatible model servings are supported.

### Validated Models

The following models are validated by the service:

| Model ID                      | Description               | Parameters    | HF link   |
|-------------------------------| --------------------------|---------------|-----------|
