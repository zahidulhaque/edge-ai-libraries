The Time Series Analytics microservice provides the analytics capabilities for a time series
use case.

It is a powerful, flexible solution for real-time analysis of time series data. Built on top
of **Kapacitor**, it enables both streaming and batch processing, seamlessly integrating with
**InfluxDB** for efficient data storage and retrieval.

What sets this microservice apart is its support for advanced analytics through
**User-Defined Functions (UDFs)** written in Python. By leveraging the Intel® Extension for
**Scikit-learn**, you can accelerate machine learning workloads within their UDFs, unlocking
high-performance anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, and other sophisticated analytics.

The key features include:

- **Bring your own Data Sets and corresponding User Defined Functions(UDFs) for custom analytics**:
Easily implement and deploy your own Python-based analytics logic, following Kapacitor’s UDF
standards.
- **Seamless Integration**: Automatically stores processed results back into InfluxDB for
unified data management and visualization.
- **Versatile Use Cases**: Ideal for anomaly detection, alerting, and advanced time series
analytics in industrial, IoT, and enterprise environments.

For more information on creating custom UDFs, see the
[Kapacitor Anomaly Detection Guide](https://docs.influxdata.com/kapacitor/v1/guides/anomaly_detection/).
