Assess Intel® hardware options, benchmark performance, and analyze key metrics to optimize
hardware selection for AI workloads.

The Visual Pipeline and Platform Evaluation Tool simplifies hardware selection for AI workloads
by enabling configuration of workload parameters, performance benchmarking, and analysis of key
metrics such as throughput, CPU usage, and GPU usage. With its intuitive interface, the tool
provides actionable insights that support optimized hardware selection and performance tuning.

## Use Cases

**Evaluating Hardware for AI Workloads**: Intel® hardware options can be assessed to balance
cost, performance, and efficiency. AI workloads can be benchmarked under real-world conditions
by adjusting pipeline parameters and comparing performance metrics.

**Performance Benchmarking for AI Models**: Model performance targets and KPIs can be validated
by testing AI inference pipelines with different accelerators to measure throughput, latency,
and resource utilization.

## Key Features

**Optimized for Intel® AI Edge Systems**:
[Pipelines can be run directly on target devices](./how-to-guides/configure-pipelines.md) for
seamless Intel® hardware integration.

**Comprehensive Hardware Evaluation**: Metrics such as CPU frequency, GPU power usage, and
memory utilization are available for detailed analysis.

**Configurable AI Pipelines**: Parameters such as input channels, object detection models, and
inference engines can be adjusted to create
[tailored performance tests](./how-to-guides/performance-testing.md).

**Automated Video Generation**: Synthetic test
[videos can be generated](./how-to-guides/use-video-generator.md) to evaluate system
performance under controlled conditions.
