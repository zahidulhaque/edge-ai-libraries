"""pipeline_runner.py

This module provides the PipelineRunner class for executing GStreamer pipelines
and extracting performance metrics (FPS).

The runner uses gst_runner.py to execute pipelines in either normal or validation
mode, providing unified interface for both production pipeline execution and

        Run pipeline in normal mode and extract FPS metrics.

        This method executes gst_runner.py with --mode normal and monitors
        the output for FPS metrics from gvafpscounter.

        After pipeline completion (success or failure), writes 0.0 to the FPS
        file to indicate that the pipeline is no longer running.

        ## gvafpscounter emits three types of FPS metrics:

        - **last**: FPS measured over only the most recent N-second window.
          Resets after each print. Highly volatile — can spike during queue
          flush at shutdown (e.g. 330 fps in a 0.47s window).

        - **average**: Cumulative mean FPS from the first measured frame to
          now. Printed every ~1 second, never resets. Represents the stable
          steady-state throughput while the pipeline is actively running.

        - **overall**: Same cumulative formula as average, but printed only
          once when the pipeline terminates. Crucially, it includes the
          shutdown period — during which GStreamer flushes buffered frames
          rapidly and then streams finish unevenly. With many streams the
          teardown can take several seconds, inflating the time denominator
          while the frame numerator barely grows, resulting in a significantly
          lower FPS than the true steady-state.

        ## Why we prefer average over overall:

        With looped pipelines stopped via max_runtime, all streams are alive
        for the full measurement window (good for average stability), but the
        forced SIGINT shutdown creates a flush burst and uneven stream
        teardown. The more streams, the longer the teardown, and the bigger
        the gap between average and overall. Using overall for benchmark
        decisions causes the binary search to systematically underestimate
        pipeline capacity.

        ## Metric selection priority (post-run):

        1. Last average line matching total_streams — best steady-state metric.
        2. Overall line matching total_streams — fallback, includes shutdown.
        3. Last average line for closest total_streams — stream count mismatch
           but still a steady-state number.
        4. Last "last" line — volatile, last resort.

        Args:
            pipeline_command: GStreamer pipeline description string.
            total_streams: Total number of streams to expect in metrics.

        Returns:
            PipelineResult containing FPS metrics, exit code, and captured output.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError: If pipeline execution fails (non-zero exit code without
                cancellation, or inactivity timeout).
