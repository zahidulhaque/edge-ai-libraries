GStreamer Pipeline Runner

This module provides a command-line tool and library API for running
GStreamer pipeline descriptions.

The runner supports two modes:

- normal: Run pipelines for production use.
- validation: Run pipelines for a limited time to verify correctness.

The runner:

1. Initializes GStreamer and hooks its debug logging into Python's logging.
2. Parses a textual pipeline description via Gst.parse_launch().
3. Treats the parse as FAILED if:
   - Gst.parse_launch() raises an exception, OR
   - any GStreamer ERROR-level log is emitted during parsing.
4. If parsing succeeds without ERRORs:
   - starts the pipeline (PLAYING),
   - runs it under a GLib.MainLoop for a configurable duration (max-runtime),
   - watches the bus for GStreamer ERROR and EOS messages.
5. Stops the pipeline when:
   - an ERROR is observed on the bus (run FAIL), OR
   - EOS is observed on the bus, OR
   - the max-runtime elapses (if configured), OR
   - SIGINT (Ctrl+C) is received.

Running semantics:

- Failure (exit code 1):
  * pipeline cannot be parsed (exception in parse_launch), OR
  * any GStreamer ERROR is logged during parsing (even if parse_launch
    returns a pipeline object), OR
  * a GStreamer ERROR is observed on the bus at ANY time during the run
    or shutdown, OR
  * invalid combination of mode and max-runtime arguments.
- Success (exit code 0):
  * the pipeline is parsed successfully AND
  * no GStreamer ERROR appears during parsing, run, or shutdown AND
  * the pipeline finishes via EOS, max-runtime, or SIGINT.
