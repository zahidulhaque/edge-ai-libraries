# Image to Composite Video Generator

This project generates a video by creating composite frames from images stored in subdirectories. Each frame is composed
of randomly selected images arranged in a grid, as specified in the configuration file. The video is generated using
GStreamer pipelines.

______________________________________________________________________

## Features

- Supports multiple image formats: PNG, JPEG.
- Configurable output resolution, duration, frame rate, and composite layout.
- Dynamically generates composite frames and adjusts the GStreamer pipeline based on the desired output format.
- Supports background image overlay during frame composition.
- Automatically handles image selection, resizing, and duplication when necessary.

## Configuration Parameters

The program uses a config.json file to customize the video generation process. Below is an example configuration:

```json
{
    "background_file": "/usr/src/app/background.gif",
    "base_image_dir": "/usr/src/app/images",
    "output_file": "output_file",
    "target_resolution": [1920, 1080],
    "frame_count": 300,
    "frame_rate": 30,
    "swap_percentage" : 20,
    "object_counts": {
        "cars": 3,
        "persons": 3
    },
    "object_rotation_rate": 0.25, 
    "object_scale_rate": 0.25, 
    "object_scale_range": [0.25, 1],
    "encoding": "H264",
    "bitrate": 20000,
    "swap_rate": 1
}
```

- **`background_file`**: Path to a background image (GIF, PNG, etc.) to be used in composite frames.

- **`base_image_dir`**: Path to the root directory containing categorized image subdirectories.

- **`output_file`**: Path to the final generated video file. Preference is not to give the file extension and no `.` in
  filename eg. output_file

- **`target_resolution`**: Resolution of the output video in `[width, height]` format.

- **`duration`**: Total duration of the generated video (in seconds).

- **`frame_count`**: Total number of frames in the generated video.

- **`swap_percentage`**: Percentage of images that should be swapped between frames.

- **`object_counts`**: Dictionary specifying the number of images per category in each frame.

- **`object_rotation_rate`**: Rate at which objects rotate per frame (e.g., `0.25` means a quarter rotation per frame).

- **`object_scale_rate`**: Rate at which the size of objects changes per frame (e.g., `0.25` means the object size
  changes by 25% per frame).

- **`object_scale_range`**: List specifying the minimum and maximum scale factors for the objects (e.g., `[0.25, 1]`
  means the object can scale between 25% and 100% of its original size).

- **`encoding`**: Video encoding format (e.g., `H264`).

- **`bitrate`**: Bitrate for video encoding (measured in kbps).

- **`swap_interval`**: Frequency of image swapping within frames (in seconds).

### Supported Encodings and Video Formats

| **Encoding**  | **Video Format** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **H264**      | .mp4             |
| **VP8**       | .webm            |
| **VP9**       | .webm            |
| **MPEG4**     | .avi             |
| **ProRes**    | .mov             |

## Usage

```bash
make run-videogenerator
```

The video will be generated in the `shared/videos/video-generator` directory with the specified file name.

## Note on Image Naming Convention

For consistency and organization, please ensure all image files in this folder are named using a sequential format
such as `1.png`, `2.png`, `3.png`, etc. Avoid using random or unrelated names for images.
